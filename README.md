# Blockchain Application 🔗  

## Repository Overview  

Welcome to the **Blockchain Application** repository. This repository currently contains a Voting DApp developed using Solidity, Truffle, and Ganache as a test network. Additionally, a folder exists for a future project—a Bank DApp utilizing the Mónko language.  

## Contents  

- **Voting DApp**: A decentralized application for voting, built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity and Truffle. The application leverages Ganache as a test network for development and testing purposes.  
- **Bank DApp**: Future project. This will be a decentralized banking application using the Mónko language, with functionality to manage user accounts, transactions, and secure financial operations on a blockchain.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Solidity**: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  
- **Truffle**: A development framework for Solidity that helps in deploying and testing smart contracts.  
- **Ganache**: A personal Ethereum blockchain for development and testing of smart contracts.  
- **Mónko Language**: A new blockchain language planned for the Bank DApp project.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

- 💻 **Node.js** (for running Truffle and Ganache)  
- 🛠️ **Solidity** (for writing smart contracts)  
- ⚙️ **Truffle** (for development, testing, and deployment)  
- 🌉 **Ganache** (for a local blockchain environment)  

## Future Developments  

The **Bank DApp** project using the Mónko language will provide a secure decentralized banking solution, including account management, transactions, and more. Stay tuned for updates!
